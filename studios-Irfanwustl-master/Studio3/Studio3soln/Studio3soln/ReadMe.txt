Answer to Question 4:
It does not work. Because refererence can not chainge where it refers.
Three ways:
1) Reference must refer something while pointer can be null.
2) Reference must be typed. Pointer can be untyped.
3) Reference can not change where it refers. Pointer can change where it points.
The 3rd point explains what happens when I try to use reference as exercise 3.



Answer to Question 5:
There is no difference in output. However, when using auto keyword I have to both declare and initialize pointer at the same line which was not the case for question 3.

Answer to Question 6:
I have used *,**, + and ++ operator. I have declared a double pointer str**. Then two for loops 
are used. Outer loop is used to indicate the next string and inner loop is used to print the characters of that
string. To indicate the next string I have increase str by 1 in every outer loop iteration and to print all the characters of
a string I have used (*str) ++ in the inner for loop.
